# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java

## Overview

This is a simple command-line **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented in Java. The game allows two players to take turns placing their respective marks (X or O) on a 3x3 board. The objective is to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal to win. If all spots are filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

## Features

- **Two-player mode**: Player X and Player O take turns.
- **Dynamic input validation**: Ensures that players can only place marks in valid, empty positions.
- **Win detection**: Automatically checks for win conditions after each move (rows, columns, and diagonals).
- **Tie detection**: If the board is full and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.
- **Clear output**: The current state of the game board is displayed after every move.
